        Between the concrete pillars of the old garage a single spider spun his web. The decrepit cracked floor is covered in tire stains and skid marks, but the lot is empty and the parking place lines are faded to near invisibility. Across the street Austin Friday night activities continue. Cabs pick up residents to bring them to homes, bars, night jobs and schools. The parking garage is lifeless as it casts a looming shadow over the nearby shops.

        Then a slight crunch and rustle of dry live oak leaves whispers through the hollow concrete shell. The yellow dust of pollen falls against a photographerâ€™s black shoes. He walks up the stairs being careful not to support his weight with the brown rusty step. Entering the lot, he walks toward the center. The SD card is slid into place. Click-Flash. The spider freezes in place. The image is too dark and grainy, so the photographer ups the ISO and lowers the shutter speed. Click-Flash. Now the image is too bright. A street light glares in the background.

        The photographer fiddles with the camera. His fingers move with precision and care while adjusting his third eye. He shoots; checks; corrects; shoots again. Over and over until he gets it just right. He shoots until the image is clear in visuals and feeling.

        Then the photographer's camera drops to his core. It clings around his neck by the strap as he moves out of the scene. The spider resumes spinning its web in the empty shell of the parking garage.
